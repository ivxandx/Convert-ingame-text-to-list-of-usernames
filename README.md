#### Example usage:
""" <br>
username1: sample text sample text sample text <br>
username2: sample text sample text sample text <br>
username3: sample text sample text sample text <br>
username4: sample text sample text sample text <br>
""" <br>

#### This will return:

username1 <br>
username2 <br>
username3 <br>
username4 <br>

#### in the new text file.
