Takes in a long string in the style of 'name: text name: text name: text' and writes all the names to a new text file. Also creates a list that stores all the names.

Example usage:
'''
username1: sample text sample text sample text
username2: sample text sample text sample text
username3: sample text sample text sample text
username4: sample text sample text sample text
'''

This will return:

username1
username2
username3
username4

in the new text file.
